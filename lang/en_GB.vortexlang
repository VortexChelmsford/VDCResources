// VORTEX LANGUAGE PACK 
// GB English - (United Kingdom English) by Vortex Chelmsford 
// Information available on Vortex Website
{
	// Please give information about the language used within this file.
	// The full name of the language should go within the "Name" item.
	// The abbreviation should be the first two lower case letters of the name, for example, "English" is "en"
	// followed by an underscore, then the name of the country the language is set out to use spellings for,
	// for example, for spellings in Great Britian, the code is GB. Hence the name "en_GB".
	// Lastly, type the name of the country represented in the last part of the abbreviation in the "Country" section.
	"Language": {
		"Name": "English - GB",
		"Abbreviation": "en_GB",
		"Country": "United Kingdom"
	},
	
	// If modifying this pack, change "Supported" to **ANYTHING NUMBER OTHER THAN ZERO**
	// Set the "VLP_Code" to **ANYTHING ABOVE 10,000**
	"VortexLanguagePack": {
		"Supported": 1,
		"VLP_Code": 2
	},
	
	// "LanguageDefined" contains all of the defined language strings for this language pack. All of the strings are 
	// seperated into groups (for example; "Dashboard_SystemSound" and "Dashboard_Instructions"), the individual strings
	// are one level below the groups, for example: "GroupTitle" and "GetVolume_Description". Modify the values after the 
	// colon ( : ) to modify what VDC will show on runtime.
	// REMEMBER: If you modify the syntax, or the names of the objects (eg modifying "GroupTitle") will cause a problem
	// with the language pack file, and that string will not be read.
	// You can see that the language pack couldn't be read by either looking for a red ERROR message from Language Manager in
	// the console, or if one or more string is showing as something starting with: "langstrings.LanguageDefined".
	// If you break the JSON syntax, causing an illegal syntax modification, the entire file will break and you'll either have
	// to find the error or rewrite the language pack. This is commonly the problem when no controls are showing the correct 
	// text. Remember though, not all controls use this system yet, and that will not be the case for a long time to come, due
	// purely to the massive amount of controls used within the Application (nearly 40,000).
